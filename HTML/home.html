            Laura Biel and her boyfriend are on a dream vacation in beautiful Sicily. On the second day of their trip, her twenty-ninth birthday, she is kidnapped. Her kidnapper is none other than the head of a powerful Sicilian crime family, the incredibly handsome, young Don Massimo Torricelli, who is determined to possess her at all costs. Massimo has his reasons. During an earlier attempt on his life, a vision appeared before his eyes: a beautiful woman, identical to Laura. After surviving the attack, he vows that he will find the woman in his vision and make her his own. No matter what.

            For 365 days, Massimo will keep Laura captive in his palatial estate and attempt to win her heart. If she doesnâ€™t fall in love with him during this time, he will let her go. But if she tries to escape at any point, he will track her down and kill her entire family.
            
            Soon Laura develops a fascination with her handsome and powerful captor. But as a precarious, risky relationship forms between them, forces outside their control threaten to tear them apart...

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in  their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)

        <div class="aboutBook">Jackie, an attractive young housewife seeking to revive her sex life with her husband, Jerry, sets up a romantic weekend at an inn in the Pocono Mountains. During that weekend, they both have a series of intense dreams. Jackie's dream is about her sex life, and Jerry's three dreams foretell international incidents that impact oil prices and the financial markets.

            Upon the couple's return to Princeton, they are shocked when the events in their dreams start to unfold and become reality. The events that follow dramatically change the lives of this couple and their close friends.
            
            The Inn of Destiny is a salacious romance novel with a touch of the supernatural. The sex is titillating, and the plot in the Middle East is as current as today.
